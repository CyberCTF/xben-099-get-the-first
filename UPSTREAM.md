The vendored folder is that commit's benchmark folder, unchanged, without its Git history, canary
strings included. The flag is the one upstream's Makefile builds with (`common.mk`: `FLAG{` + the
SHA-256 of `XBEN-099-24` + `}`), passed there as the `FLAG` build argument; Isoloom builds without build
arguments, so the overlay `build/app/Dockerfile` (the benchmark's `app/Dockerfile`, its COPY sources
pointed into `app/`) makes that value the argument's default.

The other machines:

- `mongodb`: `build/mongodb/Dockerfile` (see its header comment).

To update, replace the vendored folder with a newer commit's benchmark folder, then change this file.
